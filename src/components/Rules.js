            <ol>
                <li>Add up to 6 players/teams</li>
                <li>Change the targets you are aiming for or play with the default targets</li>
                <li>The traditional way to play is by points, but you can also just see who hits all the targets first</li>
                <li>You do not have to hit them in order, but that is an option</li>
                <li>If you do play by points, then once you hit 3 targets, the number is open, and hitting that number will score you points</li>
                <li>If all players have hit the target 3 times, then the target becomes closed and no one can collect more points</li>
                <li>If you hit a triple, it's 3 marks. If you hit a double, it's 2 marks.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>The overall object of Cricket is to have more points than the other team once you have hit all the targets 3 times.</p>

            <h3>Tips</h3>
            <p>Unless, you decide to play the targets in order, a good strategy is to aim for the bullseye, because if you miss, you may hit another target that you need.</p>
            <p>You will need to decide if you want to try to close out your opponents' numbers or collect more points on your own targets.</p>
